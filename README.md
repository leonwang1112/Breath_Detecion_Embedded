# Breath_Detecion_Embedded
This project aims to provide a potential solution to help with the patients with respiratory problems  by detecting their breath every 10 seconds. With detailed investigation and research,  we adopted STM32F4 microcontroller and Adafruit SGP30 air quality sensor as the main body  and successfully accomplished the breath detection challenge.
